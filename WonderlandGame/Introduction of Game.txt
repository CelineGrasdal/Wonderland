You are Alice from Alice in Wonderland. You want to be treated like a grown up. 
Your goal is to prove to yourself and others that you are grown up without losing 
sanity along the way. Maybe your sister can tell you how. Try to talk to her. I 
will narrate your story as you go along. I can understand 1 or 2 word commands. 
I will only read the first and second word of your command and act on what I have read. 
To talk to your sister, type "talk sister". You start with 10 sanity points. 
If you lose all your sanity points at any point in the game, you lose the game. You can check your current sanity by typing
"san", or "sanity". Good Luck!
