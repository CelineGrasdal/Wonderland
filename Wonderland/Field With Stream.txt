You are in a field with a stream. Your sister is fast asleep nearby.
You are supposed to entertain yourself until your mother calls you for tea.
You must be home in time for tea.
A lane goes to the east and west.
Suddenly, a white rabbit appears.
"I'm late! I'm late!", the rabbit says. He looks at his pocket watch. 
"Very late!" The rabbit hops away to the east.
