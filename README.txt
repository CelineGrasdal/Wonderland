
This is a text-based adventure game written in Java that I created
for a university project. It's based on the classic Alice in Wonderland 
novel. I'm continually to improving upon this to bring it beyond the original
requirements of the project.

To run Wonderland, JDK Version 20 or greater must be installed
and all files in Wonderland folder must be downloaded.
