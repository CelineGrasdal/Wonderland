/**
 *
 * Test Plan
 *
 * 1. Run java Wonderland. 
 * EXPECTED: 
 *    Command box should display the following:
 *    text = You are Alice from Alice in Wonderland. You want to be treated like a grown up. 
 *    Your goal is to prove to yourself and others that you are grown up without losing 
 *    sanity along the way. Maybe your sister can tell you how. Try to talk to her. I 
 *    will narrate your story as you go along. I can understand 1 or 2 word commands. 
 *    I will only read the first and second word of your command and act on what I have read. 
 *    To talk to your sister, type "talk sister". You start with 10 sanity points. 
 *    You need 15 sanity points to win the game. If you lose all your sanity points at 
 *    any point in the game, you lose the game. You can check your current sanity by typing
 *    "san", or "sanity". Good Luck!
 *    whitespace for recieving user input
 *    text to display program response to user input
 *
 * ACTUAL:
 *    Command box displays as expected.
 *
 * 2. Good data cases:
 * EXPECTED:
 *    Run the following test cases by typing the input value and pressing enter:
 *    'talk sister' -> output should be : If you want to be treated like a grown-up, you have 
 *    to stop being scared of everything. You could start by exploring the carrot field to the 
 *    1east of here by yourself.
 *    'i' -> output should be a list of items the user currently has.
 *    'quit' -> output should be: You have exited the game. You will have to start again.
 *    'take rose' -> output should be: You aleady have the rose
 *                 or output should be: The rose isn't available to take
 *                 or output should be whitespace
 * ACTUAL:
 *    Results displayed as expected.
 * 3. Bad data cases:
 * EXPECTED:
 *    Run the following test cases by typing the input value and pressing enter:
 *    'run around' -> output should be: I don't know what you mean.
 *    '3' -> output should be: I don't know what you mean.
 *    'go run' -> output should be: I don't know what you mean.
 *    'take rose please' -> output should be: You already have the rose
 *                         or output should be: The rose isn't available to take
 *                         or output should be whitespace
 * ACTUAL:
 *    Results displayed as expected.
